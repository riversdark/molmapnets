# molmapnets
> Neural networks for MolMap generated features.


This package implements the neural network architects originally presented in the [MolMap package](https://github.com/shenwanxiang/bidd-molmap), with two important differences:

- The package is written using literate programming so the implementation, testing, and documentation are done together. You can find the documentation on the [package blog site](https://riversdark.github.io/molmapnets/).
- The models are implemented in PyTorch.

## Install

First you need to install MolMap and ChemBench (you can find the detailed installation guide [here](https://github.com/shenwanxiang/bidd-molmap#installation), then simply

`pip install molmapnets`
